**A little about me, and my experience.**
Early in my career did consulting doing things like web development, biz infrastructure, full stop digital marketing shop type stuff, from their graduated more into corporate work, and from there enterprise platform development. 

1. Consulting:
		1. Imperative Design
		2. Home Depot corporate sales metrics, Coca Cola, CHOA, BBC America
	2. Infosurv / Intengo ( PHP, Platform development, ETL pipelines, Product, and customer portal )
	3. Paya: Lead their payaconnect  team: Next Gen payments gateway
	
**What do I do?**
   Manage everything to do with development within the organization, only tech thing I dont lead is their website SEO/ SEM efforts. Architecture, delivery, POC, helping team members when they get stuck, occasional development as well, new process implementation and overhaul. ( Test tooling, Kafka implementation, ect.. )

**Notable wins:**
	* Stabilization of legacy platforms
	* Re-architecture of GC
	* Re-development of DIP to a modern ETL platform
	* Creation of CI/CD pipeline
	* Wider Introduction of testing into the delivery process making it integral to the development process
	* Fine tuning of the development process: Increased quality checkpoints, focus on tightening cycle time, TTR, team proactivity, transparency of testing, Integration of alerting and status into our communication mediums
	* Creation of local development dockerized environments for the team

**Team goals**
	1. Reduce costs on platform
	2. Increase testing coverage across our platform
	3. Improve our data storage, purging and retention architecture
	4. Fully automate the deployment pipelines to further remove bottlenecks 
	5. Ephemeral dev environments & fwcli
	6. Better birds eye view of test coverage
	7. Transition more things to Kafka ( Use as a caching layer, take load of our systems, decouple things from point to point architecture ) 
	
**Personal Goals**
* Expanding my NLP knowledge

**Questions:**
1. **What does the future look like for my team?**
	1. When these announcements happen, I imagine there's going to be some apprehension so just wondering what messaging you would like conveyed?  Is the team going to stay in tact?
	2. Are we going to be continuing to work on our own product or will be used more widely within the MCO organization?
	3. We have a number of team changes we would like to make but were holding until this aquisition ( QA )
	4. Will there be a change in product direction ( integration primarily with MCO platform and independent product evolution secondary? )
	   
2. - [>] From our earlier conversations, I surmised that you all are very cost conscious, a few notable cost aims for me that I would love to see happen are sunsetting our legacy products and improving our storage architecture among other things that have been lower priority over product development. How would those types of things line up with your own priorities?
   
3. How does our cost of operation compare to your current outsourced team? If higher is that a concern?
4. Contractor contracts
5. Ability to hire internationally?
6. Reporting structure?
7. Communications across companies? Teams?
8. PCIA compliant? Does that mean FW will need to be PCIA?
9. Cant remember, did you say you were an AWS or Azure shop?
