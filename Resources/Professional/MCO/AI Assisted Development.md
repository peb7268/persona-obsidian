## Research Workflow
organizing the information 
				& 
rapidly intaking the information

---

### GPT Powered Notes
	* Mind Mapping
	* GPT 

---

### Readwise & Reader - faster learning and info uptake

## Development
### COPILOT
1. Expectations: It's like a JR developer at your beck and call
2. Talk directly to GPT right from your editor: Q&A
3. Get unstuck & get inspiration
	1. Look at multiple ways to do the same problem
4. Prototype code & tests faster
---
Python Example: **Economics EDA with Fred API & Matplotlib** 

---
Typescript example: Some of our own code

---
   
### COPILOT LABS
1. Easier way to do all of the above
2. Translate code from one language to another

---
   
### CHATGPT
1. Ask it to explain code: Revisit the python economics code
2. Ask it for recommendations to improve your code.
