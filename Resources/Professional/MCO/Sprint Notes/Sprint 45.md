Hiring Rock
-   What worked/ went right?
	- hiring: Found a good candiate, had some coaching to do, seems to be on track now, included Giorgio which was good since it get's team buy-in but also since he'll obviously be working close with him
-   What didn’t work/ went wrong?
	- Initial scheduling and communication was a little rocky but smoothed out
-   Why?

MER / HLN Incident Wrap Up
-   What worked/ went right?
	- Great team work to grind through stuff that was not very clear
	- People got out of their comfort zone to stretch and work together
-   What didn’t work/ went wrong?
	- Not very measureable that it's resolved due to lack of roll out
-   Why?

OpsGenie
-   What worked/ went right?
	- Got a lot of the infrastructure work completed so we can make this happen
-   What didn’t work/ went wrong?
	- Constrains on Giorgio's time have slowed final steps and some deployments so we can turn everything on
-   Why?
