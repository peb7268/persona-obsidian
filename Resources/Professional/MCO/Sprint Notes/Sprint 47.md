## Action Items from Previous Sprint
* [-] Announcement for focus time for team
* KT for deployments & releases so leads can deploy all the way up to production and know how to rollback, ect..
* [-] - Talk more about how an async backlog refinement would work. Geekbot to send to all team leads, Sean, and CS.

## Went well
* Even with issue after issue, team still managed to kill it. 
* People jumping in at all hours to fix things. Big shout out to Mr. Ken for his sense of ownership on R&A issues and making sure they get done.  ( Ken to R&A issues: /giphy will smith slap )
* Thank you to Egor for the research and assist and after hours help, and to Mr. G of course.
