## Recommendations & Ideas around sprint deployment
- [x] Shift the sprint date so done is after deployment on Mon. Maybe sprint ends on Tues.
- [x] Time in QA
- [x] How often stuff bounced back from QA
- Commit to ~ 30 points
- Look into re-estimating things if they cross multiple sprints
- Enable Jira resolutions: ( For blocked as well as done )
- [ ] Schedule a post mortem on the IM's tasks to talk about  could it have been split better or dependencies reduced somehow?
- [ ] Spend 20 mins in prod meeting before Sprint end to talk about what that is unfinished that should be ejected from the next sprint
- [ ] Look at ceremonies going into next sprint. 
- [ ] Consolidate kickoff, and goal alignment consolidated to Tuesday 
- [ ] Review ( finished vs planned, where do we stand ) and retro on Monday
- [ ]
