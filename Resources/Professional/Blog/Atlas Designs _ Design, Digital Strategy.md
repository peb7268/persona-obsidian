&lt;p&gt;Having done high end stucco and custom stone work work accross the country this company already had a solid foundation to work with. The company was looking to relocate to a different state accross the country and rebrand for the new market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id&#x3D;&quot;ourstrategy&quot;&gt;Our Strategy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a wealth of beautiful pictures of their work to draw upon and many years of experience, all we needed to do is to get the word out about this business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this we decided to focus on a few different strategies to target many different marketing channels at the same time. Some of those were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organic Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geo-targeted Pay per click&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6 id&#x3D;&quot;oursolutions&quot;&gt;Our solutions&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step we always do is to target which cities, which neighborhoods, and which areas our client wants to target. Then from there we develop a keyword mix and digital strategy to get our messaging out to those markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The social media in this case that we deemed most effective was Nextdoor, but we also used houzz, and pintrest. If you haven&#x27;t heard of it, Nextdoor is quickly becoming the go to place for homeowners to find small and medium sized businesses alike to do work in their negihborhoods and to get recomendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we focused on each service they offer and treated each as its&#x27; own unique business vertical, organically optimizing each page. That makes every page you vist on their site a landing page for tha keyword. In other words, they&#x27;re the modern equivilent of a digital billboard for that service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, to boostrap the marketing exposure quickly, we utilized pay-per-click advertising with google. A little known fact is that the better your site is optimzed for a particular keyword, the cheaper the PPC is for that keyword!&lt;/p&gt;
