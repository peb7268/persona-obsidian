We don't need to go to counseling because we're capable of discussing things ourselves. 
So I would like to think critically about this conversation for two reasons:

1. To improve our communications
2. To not pass on bad habits to our kids

I think this highlights two pieces of communication friction

## Different isn't wrong
## You should be able to admit a mistake without feeling bad
* It's Ok to make a mistake

**Situation**: Alina put the kids to sleep. When I went to give them milk in the morning not enough milk for even half a bottle.

*What I said:*
Since you didn't let me know we were low on milk, I had to go to the store this morning so I could make your coffee. 

*What she said would be better:* 
Hey, I realized there was not enough milk in the fridge when I went to give the babies bottles. 
Can you please check next time?

*Why she doesn't like what I said:* 
1. She thinks it's accusatory - I think it's just a recount of history

*Questions:*
1. Is it a bad way to say it or just different?

*Alternate scenario:*
I drive her car, I run it down to fumes and dont put gas in because I dont have time.
When she goes to work the next day she has to stop for gas and thus is a few minutes late.

If I say, how was your day, and she says, good but I was late for work because you didnt put gas
in the car. 

*Questions:*
1. Is that accusatory or a recount of history?

## Takeaways
* Different isn't wrong
* You should be able to admit a mistake without feeling bad
* Pick the time to discuss some things: When it's been a stressful time, be aware and please say it's not a good time to talk, or each person should be able to say, I think we should discuss that later.


* I'm not interested in a Roomate 
* I don't want excuses. I am working on the stuff I need to do to be a good partner and I expect the same from you.
* don't take your stress w the kids of lifes disillusionment out on me. 
* I want you to love me and respect me, but if you don't respect me you better at least treat me like you do. 



### There is a time for post event discussion 

* When the kids are screaming I literally can't focus on what you're saying. The more I try the more I melt down in my thinking and become overloaded. 
* would you rather me force a conversation,  where even when I try and stand there and talk to you, I am using all my focus not to melt down in attempt to hear you, or do you want to wait 5 minutes, let me get out kids pacified, and then be able to give you the focus and attention you deserve?
* This is not me putting you off, it's me wanting to hear and be able to process EVERYTHING you have to tell me, because it's important to me, rather than a fraction of it that I'm able to process at an inopportune time.
