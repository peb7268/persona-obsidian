## PushUps

To build muscle with push-ups, you can try these tips:

- Do three to six sets of six to 12 repetitions with only 60 to 90 seconds of rest between sets
- Aim for a minimum of 8–12 reps per set but no more than 30
- Try more challenging push-up variations
- Try a plyometric push up
- Add external resistance once you've mastered the bodyweight push-up
- Increase the number of total push-ups gradually
- Push each set close to failure rather than stopping well short of it


## Pull Ups

Pull-ups are a foundational strength training exercise that can help you build muscle. They strengthen your chest, shoulders, arms, and core.

To build muscle, you need to do between 8 to 15 reps for 3 to 5 sets of pull-ups done 2 to 3x per week. You can also try these variations:

- Pick 3-4 pull-up exercises for each workout.
- Do 4-5 sets for each variation.
- Use a rep range of 7-10.
- Train pull-ups twice a week.
- Rest around 60 seconds from a set to another.
- Do wide-grip pull-ups to focus more on the lats.
- Do medium-grip pull-ups to put more emphasis on the biceps.
- Do chin-ups to get bigger arms.

You can achieve your first unassisted pull-up in anything from four to 12 weeks.
