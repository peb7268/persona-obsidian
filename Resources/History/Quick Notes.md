## Agentic Tool Chains
* [ ] Google Agentic Development Toolchain
* [ ] Anthropic Development Toolchain
* [ ] How to carry context between ai tools. Claude Desktop -> Claude Code Web -> Claude Code
* [ ] Same workflow for Google
      
* [ ] Cloudflare tunnel IaC for NAS so I can have all my tunnels under one file.

## Agentic workflow
* [>] Is there a way to save pre-named terminal sessions in vscode?
* [ ] Track token usage / cost per api key at the top of my daily note via dataviewjs api api call to antropic?

* The claude agents / terminals to run:
	* claude-pm: using task-master with jira mcp / linear mcp to manage the sub-agents
	* claude-pm should keep track of what the current task is for each agent as well as what the current task is the user is working on outside of the agents. It should answer, what are we working on, and get a list of the non-agentic and agentic tasks in flight. 
		* claude-ui
		* claude-backend
	* processes
	* shell - git, ect..

* Having my work agent:
	* [ ] Keep a list of active projects
	* [ ] Keep a list of what tasks are next -> Using linear preferably
	* [ ] Being able to use taskmaster for the current linear task over X complexity and keep claude in sync
	* [ ] See the current task list and active clients in the obsidian dashboard
	* [ ] Is there a linear MCP server?


- [x] Setup that open bubbles app on mac
- [ ] Review budget in Actual


## Farro
* Setup a Farro linear project
* South subburban sports complex, highlands ranch community centers. 
	* cards coupons tied to toast, present ID for server
* Review menu

## 4GC
* Remove the duplicate picture for the showroom on 4GC
* Setup the staging environment for 4GC

## JFL
* Setup JFL project in linear


## NAS
* [ ] Look at adding nextcloud / seafile for local document management on the nas
* [ ] Look at adding paper-ngx for OCR'ing documents and files, see if it integrates with nextcloud or seafile
* [ ] Can I link bitwarden somehow with these so I have a universal search ( maybe use that tag manager app I was play with to bridge them all )

* How to add nice tables in obsidian, drag and drop
* Feedback from Rob about Mongo email:
	  1. to the first sentence - hours of customer impact (partial or total just the big number) Was it 40+ hours over the different incidents?
	    
	2. Estimate of hours effort MCO spent rebuilding/indexes. Roughly - 10 man days? Did this take from engineering, impacting roadmap?
	    
	3. 1 year support? How did you decide that? If you worked out a $ figure from above, it would be greater? Eitherway my typical approach is to ask them how they plan to compensate us for our losses. Let them calculate - internally 1 year support might be our target: if so we would start with 2 years :)
	    
	4. Last paragraph - "unreasonable to require customers to maintain an active support”. I don’t think this is reasonable.. :) there is certainly an argument about compensation on paid advice that was incorrect.. but maintain active contracts on commercial version of products is normal.. 
	    
	5. Do you have the number we spent with them over the last 12 months? It can be interesting to spell it out.
	    
	6. If you are serious about reviewing elastic as an alternative, you could choose to say “leadership are now asking me if mongo is the right solution”…  (you/someone needs to keep the relationship).
